            While Cmdr was originally designed to make debugging easier, Cmdr has been popularised as a general console and command system due to its powerful features and extensible nature. Of course, you don't need to use it for debugging; Cmdr can be used in whatever way works for you
          </p>

          <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
            Cmdr provides a friendly API that lets developers choose how they want Cmdr to work, to register their own commands, choose a different key bind for activating the console, or even disable Cmdr altogether.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
            Cmdr has a robust and friendly type validation system which gives users real-time feedback as they type. By the time the command actually gets to your code, you can be assured that all of the arguments are present and of the correct type, keeping both typos and exploiters at bay.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
            Cmdr has been around for over five years and is trusted in games with billions of visits earning millions of dollars worth of revenue. <Link to="/docs/intro#why-should-i-use-it">Tell me more â†’</Link>
