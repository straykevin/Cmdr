# Report security vulnerability

We take the security of Cmdr extremely seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability within the library, you need to report it to us.

Cmdr's [Security Policy](https://github.com/evaera/Cmdr/blob/master/SECURITY.md) outlines:

- what we expect from researchers and reporters
- what developers and reporters can expect from us
- what we consider a security issue and what we don't
- how we'll handle security reports behind the scenes
- how we respond to security issues
- how to securely and appropriately report vulnerabilities to us

We recommend reading this policy fully before you report any vulnerabilities. This helps us ensure that you understand the policy and act in compliance with it.

## A quick note for our users

It's important that you keep your libraries up to date. We do not monitor, accept reports pertaining to, provide support for, or patch bugs on old versions of Cmdr.

If you're experiencing issues, our first recommendation will always be to update Cmdr; this applies even if the update is major (breaking).

Making sure you're always running the newest version of Cmdr will give you access to the latest features and bug fixes, and also keep your game safe from any vulnerabilities we find or are alerted to.
